Evaluation of functionality of an algorithm that measures throughput between two links to determine performance of the network:

  Overall performance of the network is measured through various parameters like Bandwidth, Latency, Throughput, Error Rate 
  in order to determine the quality of network. This paper as the aforementioned title points, focuses primarily on evaluating the functionality of an algorithm 
  that measures throughput between two links. The experiment is carried out with Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Connection in the transport layer. TCP Client
  executed from RB2 link is developed to request a file, which is 1.7 MB in size, from TCP Server residing at RB1 which responds back with the file. Throughput is 
  measured for this request-response interaction between between the links, i.e the client and server. The total time taken for the Server to send the file and the 
  total time taken for the Client to receive the file is measured. Even though both Client and Server transact the same file, the time taken to send or to receive 
  differ due to Network traffic, load and packet availability, transformations. The main ideology was that the time taken by the Server to send the file was less 
  than the time taken by the Client to receive the file.
