Evaluation of Network Performance using a Media Segment over a Transmission Control Protocol Connection :


                  Network performance including its quality can be evaluated through various parameters like Bandwidth, Latency, Throughput and Error Rate. Adaptive bitrate streaming (ABS) is a performance management technique for streaming multimedia over computer networks. Most of the video streaming approaches were founded on RTP or RTSP but ABS technologies are built for transmission over broad distribution networks. This paper as the aforementioned title points, focuses primarily on the Evaluation of Network performance using a Media Segment over a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. The Experiment is carried out by observing the time taken by a TCP server to send and time taken by a TCP client to download a media file. The media file (approximately 1MB in size), is then downloaded repeatedly in order to observe the changes in the download time. The Experiment is carried out on two isolated servers which does not consist of any traffic other than the one generated by the programs. The main observations and ideology are that the time taken for sending the media segment is less at server side than the time taken for receiving the segment at client side. Also, a steady improvement was observed in download time when the segment was downloaded repeatedly.
